## Teacher Forcing

**Teacher Forcing** is a technique to quickly and efficiently train recurrent neural network models that use the ground truth from a prior time step as input. In sequence prediction models, the output from the last time step y(t-1) as input for the model at the current time step X(t). It is used in tasks such as Machine Translation, Caption Generation, Text Summarization, etc.

The problem with this training approach is that since the model is in learning phase, the output generated by previous time step will not be accurate and so each successive steps would get affected. This is like learning subject A from a student who herself is learning subject A. This leads to slower convergence of the model and instability in the model.

Solution to this problem is instead of learning from a student, learning from teacher would give better esults. The teacher in this case would be the target values. Teacher forcing works by using the actual or expected output from the training dataset at the current time step y(t) as input in the next time step X(t+1), rather than the output generated by the network(y_hat(t)).

Consider above example.

Pros:

Training with Teacher Forcing converges faster. This is because in the early stages of training, the predictions of the model are very bad. If we do not use Teacher Forcing, the hidden states of the model will be updated by a sequence of wrong predictions, errors will accumulate, and it is difficult for the model to learn from that.

Cons:

During inference, since there is usually no ground truth available, the model will need to feed its own previous prediction back to itself for the next prediction. Therefore there is a discrepancy between training and inference, and this might lead to poor model performance and instability. This is known as **Exposure Bias**.
