Take the code above, and make it work with any dataset. Submit the GitHub repo's ReadMe file, where I can see answers to these questions:

1) what dataset you have used

2) what problem have you solved (fill in the blank, translation, text generation, etc)

3) the output of your training for 10 epochs
