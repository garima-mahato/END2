## Part 2

1) What is a neural network neuron?

A neural network mimics the neurological system of human body. The basic building block of neural network is a neuron. Each neuron takes some input, performs some computation and generates the output.

This is how a neuron looks like. Let's dissect it and see what happens inside.

So, there are 3 operations going on inside a single neuron. A lot is going on inside a tiny circle. Let's unpack it.

2) What is the use of the learning rate?

3) How are weights initialized?

4) What is "loss" in a neural network?

5) What is the "chain rule" in gradient flow?
