## Part 2

#### 1) What is a neural network neuron?

A neural network mimics the neurological system of human body. The basic building block of neural network is a neuron. Each neuron takes some input, performs some computation and generates the output.

This is how a neuron looks like. Let's dissect it and see what happens inside.

So, there are 3 operations going on inside a single neuron. A lot is going on inside a tiny circle. Let's unpack it.

Each input(*x<sub>i</sub>*) to the neuron is assigned a weight(*w_i*), where subscript *i* denotes the input index. Below computations happen inside the neuron:

> i) multiplication of input and weights: 


#### 2) What is the use of the learning rate?

#### 3) How are weights initialized?

#### 4) What is "loss" in a neural network?

#### 5) What is the "chain rule" in gradient flow?
