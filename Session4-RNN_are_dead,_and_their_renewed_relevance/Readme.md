---

## Assignment: 

1) Refer to the file we wrote in the [class](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-xwX32O0WYOqcCROJnnJiSdzScPCudAM?usp=sharing): Rewrite this code, but this time remove RNN and add LSTM. 

2) Refer to this [file](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12Pciev6dvYBJ7KxwSHruG-XMwcoj0SfJ). 
> 1) The questions this time are already mentioned in the file. Take as much time as you want (but less than 7 days), to solve the file. Once you are done, then write your solutions in the quiz. 
> 2) Please note that the Session 4 Assignment Solution will time out after 15 minutes, as you just have to copy-paste your answers.
